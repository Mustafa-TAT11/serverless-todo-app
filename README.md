# 📝 Serverless Personal To-Do List Application

A simple and scalable personal to-do list app built using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **DynamoDB**, and **S3**.  
This project is developed as part of a cloud computing internship to demonstrate hands-on serverless architecture using AWS services.

Overview:-
This application allows users to:
- ✅ Add new tasks
- 📋 View existing tasks
- ✏️ Update task details
- ❌ Delete tasks

The backend logic is powered by AWS Lambda functions triggered via API Gateway, and tasks are stored in DynamoDB. The frontend is hosted on S3 as a static website.
